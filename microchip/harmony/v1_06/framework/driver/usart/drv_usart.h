    by the "event handler callback" function registered with the driver.

    The buffer handle assigned to a client request expires when the client has 
    been notified of the completion of the buffer transfer (after event handler 
    function that notifies the client returns) or after the buffer has been 
    retired by the driver if no event handler callback was set.

/* USART Driver Buffer Event Handler Function Pointer

   Summary
    Pointer to a USART Driver Buffer Event handler function

   Description
    This data type defines the required function signature for the USART driver 
    buffer event handling callback function. A client must register a pointer
    to a buffer event handling function whose function signature (parameter  
    and return value types) match the types specified by this function pointer
    in order to receive buffer related event calls back from the driver.
    
    The parameters and return values and are described here and
    a partial example implementation is provided.

  Parameters:
    event           - Identifies the type of event
    
    bufferHandle    - Handle identifying the buffer to which the vent relates
    
    context         - Value identifying the context of the application that registered
                      the event handling function.    

  Returns:
    None.

  Example:
    <code>
    void APP_MyBufferEventHandler( DRV_USART_BUFFER_EVENT event, 
                                   DRV_USART_BUFFER_HANDLE bufferHandle, 
                                   uintptr_t context )
    {
        MY_APP_DATA_STRUCT pAppData = (MY_APP_DATA_STRUCT) context;
        
        switch(event)
        {
            case DRV_USART_BUFFER_EVENT_COMPLETE:

                // Handle the completed buffer. 
                break;
            
            case DRV_USART_BUFFER_EVENT_ERROR:
            default:

                // Handle error.
                break;
        }
    }
    </code>

  Remarks:
    If the event is DRV_USART_BUFFER_EVENT_COMPLETE, it means that the data was 
    transferred successfully. 
    
    If the event is DRV_USART_BUFFER_EVENT_ERROR, it means that the data was not
    transferred successfully. The DRV_USART_ErrorGet function can be called to
    know the error. The DRV_USART_BufferProcessedSizeGet function can be
    called to find out how many bytes were processed.
    
    The bufferHandle parameter contains the buffer handle of the buffer that 
    associated with the event. 
     
    The context parameter contains the a handle to the client context,  
    provided at the time the event handling function was registered using the
    DRV_USART_BufferEventHandlerSet function.  This context handle value is 
    passed back to the client as the "context" parameter.  It can be any value 
    necessary to identify the client context or instance (such as a pointer to
    the client's data) instance of the client that made the buffer add request.

    The event handler function executes in the driver peripheral's interrupt
    context when the driver is configured for interrupt mode operation. It is
    recommended of the application to not perform process intensive or blocking
    operations with in this function.

    The DRV_USART_BufferAddRead and DRV_USART_BufferAddWrite functions can
    be called in the event handler to add a buffer to the driver queue. These
    functions can only be called to add buffers to the driver whose event
    handler is running. For example, buffers cannot be added USART2 driver in
    USART1 driver event handler.

  Summary:
    Initializes the USART instance for the specified driver index.

  Description:
    This routine initializes the USART driver instance for the specified driver
    index, making it ready for clients to open and use it. The initialization
    data is specified by the init parameter. The initialization may fail if the
    number of driver objects allocated are insufficient or if the specified
    driver instance is already initialized. The driver instance index is
    independent of the USART module ID. For example, driver instance 0 can be
    assigned to USART2.  If the driver is built statically, then some of the
    initialization parameters are overridden by configuration macros. Refer to
    the description of the DRV_USART_INIT data structure for more details on
    which members on this data structure are overridden.

  Returns:
    If successful, returns a valid handle to a driver instance object.  
    Otherwise, returns SYS_MODULE_OBJ_INVALID.

  Example:
    <code>
    // The following code snippet shows an example USART driver initialization.
    // The driver is initialized for normal mode and a baud of 300. The
    // receive queue size is set to 2 and transmit queue size is set to 3.

  Summary:
    Opens the specified USART driver instance and returns a handle to it.
	<p><b>Implementation:</b> Dynamic</p>

  Description:
    This routine opens the specified USART driver instance and provides a
    handle that must be provided to all other client-level operations to
    identify the caller and the instance of the driver. The ioIntent 
    parameter defines how the client interacts with this driver instance.
    
    The DRV_IO_INTENT_BLOCKING and DRV_IO_INTENT_NONBLOCKING ioIntent options
    additionally affect the behavior of the DRV_USART_Read and
    DRV_USART_Write functions. If the ioIntent is DRV_IO_INTENT_NONBLOCKING,
    then these function will not block even if the required amount of data could
    not be processed. If the ioIntent is DRV_IO_INTENT_BLOCKING, these functions
    will block until the required amount of data is processed.  If the driver is
    configured for polling and bare-metal operation, it will not support
    DRV_IO_INTENT_BLOCKING. The driver will operation will always be
    non-blocking.

    If ioIntent is DRV_IO_INTENT_READ, the client will only be able to read from
    the driver. If ioIntent is DRV_IO_INTENT_WRITE, the client will only be able
    to write to the driver. If the ioIntent is DRV_IO_INTENT_READWRITE, the
    client will be able to do both, read and write.

    Specifying a DRV_IO_INTENT_EXCLUSIVE will cause the driver to provide
    exclusive access to this client. The driver cannot be opened by any
    other client.

  Precondition:
    Function DRV_USART_Initialize must have been called before calling this
    function.

  Parameters:
    index   - Identifier for the object instance to be opened
    
    intent  - Zero or more of the values from the enumeration
              DRV_IO_INTENT "ORed" together to indicate the intended use
              of the driver. See function description for details.

  Returns:
    If successful, the routine returns a valid open-instance handle (a number
    identifying both the caller and the module instance).
    
    If an error occurs, the return value is DRV_HANDLE_INVALID. Error can occur
    - if the number of client objects allocated via DRV_USART_CLIENTS_NUMBER is
      insufficient.
    - if the client is trying to open the driver but driver has been opened
      exclusively by another client.
    - if the driver hardware instance being opened is not initialized or is
      invalid.
    - if the client is trying to open the driver exclusively, but has already
      been opened in a non exclusive mode by another client.
    - if the driver is not ready to be opened, typically when the initialize
      routine has not completed execution.

  Example:
    <code>
    DRV_HANDLE handle;

    handle = DRV_USART_Open(DRV_USART_INDEX_0, DRV_IO_INTENT_EXCLUSIVE);
    if (DRV_HANDLE_INVALID == handle)
    {
        // Unable to open the driver
        // May be the driver is not initialized or the initialization
        // is not complete.
    }
    </code>

  Remarks:
    The handle returned is valid until the DRV_USART_Close routine is called.
    This routine will NEVER block waiting for hardware.If the requested intent
    flags are not supported, the routine will return DRV_HANDLE_INVALID.  This
    function is thread safe in a RTOS application.

  Description:
    This routine closes an opened-instance of the USART driver, invalidating the
    handle. Any buffers in the driver queue that were submitted by this client
    will be removed.  After calling this routine, the handle passed in "handle" 
    must not be used with any of the remaining driver routines (with one
    possible exception described in the "Remarks" section).  A new handle must 
    be obtained by calling DRV_USART_Open before the caller may use the driver 
    again

  Precondition:
    The DRV_USART_Initialize routine must have been called for the specified
    USART driver instance.

    DRV_USART_Open must have been called to obtain a valid opened device handle.

  Parameters:
    handle       - A valid open-instance handle, returned from the driver's
                   open routine

  Returns:
    None.
                
  Example:
    <code>
    DRV_HANDLE handle;  // Returned from DRV_USART_Open

    DRV_USART_Close(handle);

    // After this point, the handle cannot be used with any other function

    // the success status of the DRV_USART_Close function.

    while(DRV_USART_CLIENT_STATUS_CLOSED != DRV_USART_ClientStatus(handle));
    
    </code>

  Remarks:
    Usually there is no need for the client to verify that the Close operation
    has completed.  The driver will abort any ongoing operations when this
    routine is called.  However, if it requires additional time to do so in a
    non-blocking environment, it will still return from the Close operation but
    the handle is now a zombie handle.  The client can only call the
    DRV_USART_ClientStatus on a zombie handle to track the completion of the
    Close operation.  The DRV_USART_ClientStatus routine will return
    DRV_CLIENT_STATUS_CLOSED when the close operation has completed.

  Summary:
    Schedule a non-blocking driver write operation.
	<p><b>Implementation:</b> Dynamic</p>

  Description:
    This function schedules a non-blocking write operation. The function returns
    with a valid buffer handle in the bufferHandle argument if the write request
    was scheduled successfully.  The function adds the request to the hardware
    instance transmit queue and returns immediately. While the request is in the
    queue, the application buffer is owned by the driver and should not be
    modified.  On returning, the bufferHandle parameter may be
    DRV_USART_BUFFER_HANDLE_INVALID for the following reasons:
    - if a buffer could not be allocated to the request
    - if the input buffer pointer is NULL
    - if the client opened the driver for read-only
    - if the buffer size is 0
    - if the transmit queue is full or the queue depth is insufficient

    If the requesting client registered an event callback with the driver, the
    driver will issue a DRV_USART_BUFFER_EVENT_COMPLETE event if the buffer was
    processed successfully or a DRV_USART_BUFFER_EVENT_ERROR event if the buffer
    was not processed successfully. 

  Precondition:
    The DRV_USART_Initialize routine must have been called for the specified
    USART device instance and the DRV_USART_Status must have returned
    SYS_STATUS_READY.

    DRV_USART_Open must have been called to obtain a valid opened device handle.

    DRV_IO_INTENT_WRITE or DRV_IO_INTENT_READWRITE must have been specified in
    the DRV_USART_Open call.

  Parameters:
    handle       - Handle of the communication channel as return by the
                   DRV_USART_Open function.

    bufferHandle - Pointer to an argument that will contain the return buffer handle.

    buffer       - Data to be transmitted.

    size         - Buffer size in bytes.

  Returns:
    The bufferHandle parameter will contain the return buffer handle. This will be
    DRV_USART_BUFFER_HANDLE_INVALID if the function was not successful.

  Example:
    <code>

    MY_APP_OBJ myAppObj;    
    uint8_t mybuffer[MY_BUFFER_SIZE];
    DRV_BUFFER_HANDLE bufferHandle;

    // myUSARTHandle is the handle returned 
    // by the DRV_USART_Open function.

  Summary:
    Allows a client to identify a buffer event handling function for the driver
    to call back when queued buffer transfers have finished.
	<p><b>Implementation:</b> Dynamic</p>

  Description:
    This function allows a client to identify a buffer event handling function 
    for the driver to call back when queued buffer transfers have finished.  
    When a client calls either the DRV_USART_BufferAddRead or 
    DRV_USART_BufferAddWrite function, it is provided with a handle identifying
    the buffer that was added to the driver's buffer queue.  The driver will
    pass this handle back to the client by calling "eventHandler" function when
    the buffer transfer has completed.
    
    The event handler should be set before the client performs any "buffer add"
    operations that could generate events. The event handler once set, persists 
    until the client closes the driver or sets another event handler (which 
    could be a "NULL" pointer to indicate no callback).

  Precondition:
    The DRV_USART_Initialize routine must have been called for the specified
    USART driver instance.

    DRV_USART_Open must have been called to obtain a valid opened device handle.

  Parameters:
    handle       - A valid open-instance handle, returned from the driver's
                   open routine

    eventHandler - Pointer to the event handler function.
    
    context      - The value of parameter will be passed back to the client 
                   unchanged, when the eventHandler function is called.  It can
                   be used to identify any client specific data object that 
                   identifies the instance of the client module (for example, 
                   it may be a pointer to the client module's state structure).

  Returns:
    None.

  Example:
    <code>
    // myAppObj is an application specific state data object.
    MY_APP_OBJ myAppObj;

    uint8_t mybuffer[MY_BUFFER_SIZE];
