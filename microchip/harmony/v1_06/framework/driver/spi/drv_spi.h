/* SPI Driver Buffer Handle

  Summary:
    Handle identifying a read or write buffer passed to the driver.

  Description:
    A buffer handle value is returned by a call to the DRV_SPI_BufferAddRead()/
    DRV_SPI_BufferAddWrite or DRV_SPI_BufferAddReadWrite() functions. This handle
	is associated with the buffer passed into the function and it allows the
	application to track the completion of the data from (or into) that buffer.
	The buffer handle value returned from the "buffer add" function is returned
	back to the client by the "callback" function registered with the driver.

    The buffer handle assigned to a client request expires when the client has
    been notified of the completion of the buffer transfer (after event handler
    function that notifies the client returns) or after the buffer has been
    retired by the driver if no event handler callback was set.

  Remarks:
    None.

/* SPI Driver Buffer Event Handler Function Pointer

   Summary:
    Pointer to a SPI Driver Buffer Event handler function

   Description:
    This data type defines the required function signature for the SPI driver
    buffer event handling callback function. A client must register a pointer
    to a buffer event handling function who's function signature (parameter
    and return value types) match the types specified by this function pointer
    in order to receive buffer related event calls back from the driver.

    The parameters and return values and return value are described here and
    a partial example implementation is provided.

  Parameters:
    event           - Identifies the type of event

    bufferHandle    - Handle identifying the buffer to which the vent relates

	context         - Value identifying the context of the application that
					  registered the event handling function.

  Returns:
    None.

  Example:
    <code>
    void APP_MyBufferEventHandler( DRV_SPI_BUFFER_EVENT event,
                                   DRV_SPI_BUFFER_HANDLE bufferHandle,
                                   uintptr_t context )
    {
        MY_APP_DATA_STRUCT pAppData = (MY_APP_DATA_STRUCT) context;

        switch(event)
        {
            case DRV_SPI_BUFFER_EVENT_COMPLETE:

                // Handle the completed buffer.
                break;

            case DRV_SPI_BUFFER_EVENT_ERROR:
            default:

                // Handle error.
                break;
        }
    }
    </code>

  Remarks:
    If the event is DRV_SPI_BUFFER_EVENT_COMPLETE, it means that the data was
    transferred successfully.

    If the event is DRV_SPI_BUFFER_EVENT_ERROR, it means that the data was
    not transferred successfully.

    The bufferHandle parameter contains the buffer handle of the buffer that
    failed.

    The context parameter contains the a handle to the client context,
    provided at the time the event handling function was  registered using the
    DRV_SPI_BufferEventHandlerSet function.  This context handle value is
    passed back to the client as the "context" parameter.  It can be any value
    necessary to identify the client context or instance (such as a pointer to
    the client's data) instance of the client that made the buffer add request.

    The event handler function executes in an interrupt context when the driver
    is configured for interrupt mode operation. It is recommended of the
    application to not perform process intensive operations with in this
    function.

  Summary:
    Initializes the SPI instance for the specified driver index.
	<p><b>Implementation:</b> Static/Dynamic</p>

  Description:
    This routine initializes the SPI driver instance for the specified driver
    index, making it ready for clients to open and use it. The initialization
    data is specified by the 'init' parameter. The initialization may fail if the
    number of driver objects allocated are insufficient or if the specified
    driver instance is already initialized. The driver instance index is
    independent of the SPI module ID. For example, driver instance 0 can be
    assigned to SPI2.  If the driver is built statically, then some of the
    initialization parameters are overridden by configuration macros. Refer to
    the description of the DRV_SPI_INIT data structure for more details on
    which members on this data structure are overridden.

  Precondition:
    None.

  Parameters:
    index  - Identifier for the instance to be initialized.  Please note this
             is not the SPI id.  The hardware SPI id is set in the initialization
             structure.  This is the index of the driver index to use.

    init   - Pointer to a data structure containing any data necessary to
             initialize the driver. If this pointer is NULL, the driver
             uses the static initialization override macros for each
             member of the initialization data structure.

  Returns:
    - If successful - returns a valid handle to a driver instance object
    - If unsuccessful - returns SYS_MODULE_OBJ_INVALID

  Example:
    <code>
    DRV_SPI_INIT        init;
    SYS_MODULE_OBJ      objectHandle;

    // Populate the SPI initialization structure
    init.spiId = SPI_ID_1,

    init.spiMode = DRV_SPI_MODE_MASTER,
    init.allowIdleRun = false,
    init.spiProtocolType = DRV_SPI_PROTOCOL_TYPE_STANDARD,
    init.commWidth = SPI_COMMUNICATION_WIDTH_8BITS,
    init.spiClk = CLK_BUS_PERIPHERAL_2,
    init.baudRate = 10000000,
    init.bufferType = DRV_SPI_BUFFER_TYPE_ENHANCED,

    if (SYS_MODULE_OBJ_INVALID == objectHandle)
    {
        // Handle error
    }
    </code>
  Remarks:
    This routine must be called before any other SPI routine is called.

    This routine should only be called once during system initialization
    unless DRV_SPI_Deinitialize is called to deinitialize the driver
    instance. This routine will NEVER block for hardware access.

  Function:
       void DRV_SPI_Deinitialize ( SYS_MODULE_OBJ object )

  Summary:
    Deinitializes the specified instance of the SPI driver module.
	<p><b>Implementation:</b> Static/Dynamic</p>

  Description:
    Deinitializes the specified instance of the SPI driver module,
    disabling its operation (and any hardware) and invalidates all of the
    internal data.

  Precondition:
    Function DRV_SPI_Initialize must have been called before calling this
    routine and a valid SYS_MODULE_OBJ must have been returned.

  Parameters:
    object -  Driver object handle, returned from DRV_SPI_Initialize

  Returns:
    None.

  Example:
    <code>
    SYS_MODULE_OBJ      object;     //  Returned from DRV_SPI_Initialize
    SYS_STATUS          status;

    DRV_SPI_Deinitialize ( object );

    status = DRV_SPI_Status( object );
    if( SYS_MODULE_UNINITIALIZED == status )
    {
        // Check again later if you need to know
        // when the driver is deinitialized.
    }
    </code>

  Remarks:
    Once the Initialize operation has been called, the De-initialize
    operation must be called before the Initialize operation can be called
    again.

    This function will NEVER block waiting for hardware. If the operation
    requires time to allow the hardware to complete, this will be reported
    by the DRV_SPI_Status operation. The system has to use DRV_SPI_Status
    to find out when the module is in the ready state.

  Summary:
    Provides the current status of the SPI driver module.
	<p><b>Implementation:</b> Dynamic</p>

  Description:
    This function provides the current status of the SPI driver module.

  Precondition:
    The DRV_SPI_Initialize function must have been called before calling
    this function.

  Parameters:
    object -  Driver object handle, returned from DRV_SPI_Initialize

  Returns:
    - SYS_STATUS_READY - Indicates that the driver is busy with a previous
    system level operation and cannot start another

  Example:
    <code>
    SYS_MODULE_OBJ      object;     // Returned from DRV_SPI_Initialize
    SYS_STATUS          status;

    status = DRV_SPI_Status( object );
    if( SYS_STATUS_READY != status )
    {
        // Handle error
    }
    </code>

  Remarks:
    Any value greater than SYS_STATUS_READY is also a normal running state
    in which the driver is ready to accept new operations.

    SYS_MODULE_UNINITIALIZED - Indicates that the driver has been
    deinitialized

    This value is less than SYS_STATUS_ERROR.

    This function can be used to determine when any of the driver's module
    level operations has completed.

    If the status operation returns SYS_STATUS_BUSY, the previous operation
    has not yet completed. Once the status operation returns
    SYS_STATUS_READY, any previous operations have completed.

    The value of SYS_STATUS_ERROR is negative (-1). Any value less than
    that is also an error state.

    This function will NEVER block waiting for hardware.

    If the Status operation returns an error value, the error may be
    cleared by calling the reinitialize operation. If that fails, the
    deinitialize operation will need to be called, followed by the
    initialize operation to return to normal operations.

  Description:
	This routine is used to maintain the driver's internal state
	machine and implement its transmit ISR for interrupt-driven implementations.
	In polling mode, this function should be called from the SYS_Tasks()
	function. In interrupt mode, this function should be called in the transmit

  Precondition:
    The DRV_SPI_Initialize routine must have been called for the specified
    SPI driver instance.

  Parameters:
    object      - Object handle for the specified driver instance (returned from

  Summary:
    Opens the specified SPI driver instance and returns a handle to it.
	<p><b>Implementation:</b> Dynamic</p>
	
  Description:
    This routine opens the specified SPI driver instance and provides a
    handle that must be provided to all other client-level operations to
    identify the caller and the instance of the driver. The ioIntent
    parameter defines how the client interacts with this driver instance.

    If ioIntent is DRV_IO_INTENT_READ, the client will only be read from
    the driver. If ioIntent is DRV_IO_INTENT_WRITE, the client will only be
    able to write to the driver. If the ioIntent in
    DRV_IO_INTENT_READWRITE, the client will be able to do both, read and
    write.

    Specifying a DRV_IO_INTENT_EXCLUSIVE will cause the driver to provide
    exclusive access to this client. The driver cannot be opened by any
    other client.
	
  Precondition:
    The DRV_SPI_Initialize function must have been called before calling
    this function.
	
  Parameters:
    drvIndex -  Index of the driver initialized with DRV_SPI_Initialize().
                Please note this is not the SPI ID.
    ioIntent -    Zero or more of the values from the enumeration
                DRV_IO_INTENT ORed together to indicate the intended use of
                the driver
				
  Returns:
    If successful, the routine returns a valid open-instance handle (a
    number identifying both the caller and the module instance).

    If an error occurs, the return value is DRV_HANDLE_INVALID. An error
    can occur when the following is true:
      * if the number of client objects allocated via
        DRV_SPI_INSTANCES_NUMBER is insufficient
      * if the client is trying to open the driver but driver has been
        opened exclusively by another client
      * if the driver hardware instance being opened is not initialized or
        is invalid
		
  Example:
    <code>
    DRV_HANDLE  handle;

    handle = DRV_SPI_Open( DRV_SPI_INDEX_0, DRV_IO_INTENT_EXCLUSIVE );

    if( DRV_HANDLE_INVALID == handle )
    {
        // Unable to open the driver
    }
    </code>
	
  Remarks:
    The handle returned is valid until the DRV_SPI_Close routine is
    called. This routine will NEVER block waiting for hardware. If the
    requested intent flags are not supported, the routine will return
    DRV_HANDLE_INVALID. This function is thread safe in a RTOS application.
    It should not be called in an ISR.

  Remarks:
	After calling this routine, the handle passed in "handle" must not be used
    with any of the remaining driver routines.  A new handle must be obtained by
    calling DRV_SPI_Open before the caller may use the driver again.  This

  Summary:
    Registers a buffer for a write operation. Actual transfer will happen
    in the Task function.
	<p><b>Implementation:</b> Dynamic</p>

  Description:
    Registers a buffer for a write operation. Actual transfer will happen
    in the Task function. The status of this operation can be monitored
    using DRV_SPI_BufferStatus function.  A optional callback can also be
    provided that will be called when the operation is complete.

  Precondition:
    The DRV_SPI_Initialize routine must have been called for the specified
    SPI driver instance.

    DRV_SPI_Open must have been called to obtain a valid opened device
    handle.

    DRV_IO_INTENT_WRITE or DRV_IO_INTENT_READWRITE must have been specified
    in the DRV_SPI_Open call.

  Parameters:
    handle -    A valid open-instance handle, returned from the driver's
                open routine
    txBuffer -  The buffer which hold the data.
    size -      Number of bytes to be written to the SPI bus.
    completeCB - Pointer to a function to be called when this queued operation is complete
    context - unused by the driver but this is passed to the callback when it is called
    jobHandle - pointer to the buffer handle, this will be set before the function returns and can be used in the ISR callback.

  Returns:
    None.

  Example:
    <code>
    DRV_HANDLE      handle;    // Returned from DRV_SPI_Open
	char   myBuffer[MY_BUFFER_SIZE], state = 0;
	DRV_SPI_BUFFER_HANDLE bufferHandle;

	switch ( state )
	{
		case 0:
			// PUT API returns data in any case, it is up to the user to use it
			bufferHandle = DRV_SPI_BufferAddWrite2( handle, myBuffer, 10, NULL, NULL, NULL );
			state++;
			break;
		case 1:
			if( DRV_SPI_BUFFER_STATUS_SUCCESS & DRV_SPI_BufferStatus( bufferHandle ) )
			{
				state++;
				// All transmitter data has been sent.

  Summary:
    Registers a buffer for a read and write operation. Actual transfer will
    happen in the Task function.
	<p><b>Implementation:</b> Static/Dynamic</p>

  Description:
    Registers a buffer for a read and write operation. Actual transfer will
    happen in the Task function. The status of this operation can be
    monitored using DRV_SPI_BufferStatus function.  A optional callback can also be
    provided that will be called when the operation is complete.

  Precondition:
    The DRV_SPI_Initialize routine must have been called for the specified
    SPI driver instance.

    DRV_SPI_Open must have been called to obtain a valid opened device
    handle.

  Parameters:
    handle -    A valid open-instance handle, returned from the driver's
                open routine
    txBuffer -  The buffer which hold the data.
    txSize   -  Number of bytes to be written to the SPI bus.
    rxBuffer -  The buffer to which the data should be written to.
    rxSize -    Number of bytes to be read from the SPI bus
    completeCB - Pointer to a function to be called when this queued operation is complete
    context - unused by the driver but this is passed to the callback when it is called
    jobHandle - pointer to the buffer handle, this will be set before the function returns and can be used in the ISR callback.
  Returns:
    None.

  Example:
	<code>
	DRV_HANDLE      handle;    // Returned from DRV_SPI_Open
	char   myReadBuffer[MY_BUFFER_SIZE], myWriteBuffer[MY_BUFFER_SIZE], state = 0;
	DRV_SPI_BUFFER_HANDLE bufferHandle;

	switch ( state )
	{
		case 0:
			// PUT API returns data in any case, it is up to the user to use it
			bufferHandle = DRV_SPI_BufferAddWriteRead2( handle, myWriteBuffer,
				myReadBuffer, 10, NULL, NULL, NULL );

			state++;
			break;

			{
				state++;
				// All transmitter data has been sent.
			}
			break;
	}

	</code>

  Remarks:

    If the driver was not able to accept the data, an overrun error status will
    be captured. To ensure that the driver is ready to accept data, the caller
    must first check the return value to DRV_SPI_BufferStatus, as shown in
    the example.

  Summary:
    Returns the transmitter and receiver transfer status.
	<p><b>Implementation:</b> Dynamic</p>

  Description:
    This returns the transmitter and receiver transfer status.

  Precondition:
    The DRV_SPI_Initialize routine must have been called for the specified
    SPI driver instance.

    DRV_SPI_Open must have been called to obtain a valid opened device handle.


  Parameters:
    handle       - A valid open-instance handle, returned from the driver's
                   open routine

  Returns:
    A DRV_SPI_BUFFER_STATUS value describing the current status of the
    transfer.

  Example:
    <code>
    DRV_HANDLE handle;    // Returned from DRV_SPI_Open

    </code>

  Remarks:
    The returned status may contain a value with more than one of the bits
    specified in the DRV_SPI_BUFFER_STATUS enumeration set.  The caller
    should perform an AND with the bit of interest and verify if the
    result is non-zero (as shown in the example) to verify the desired status
