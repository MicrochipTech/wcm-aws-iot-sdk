/* NVM Driver Event Handler Function Pointer

   Summary
    Pointer to a NVM Driver Event handler function

   Description
    This data type defines the required function signature for the 
    NVM event handling callback function. A client must register
    a pointer to an event handling function whose function signature (parameter
    and return value types) match the types specified by this function pointer
    in order to receive event calls back from the driver.
    
    The parameters and return values and return value are described here and
    a partial example implementation is provided.

  Parameters:
    event           - Identifies the type of event
    
    commandHandle   - Handle returned from the Read/Write/Erase requests
    
    context         - Value identifying the context of the application that
                      registered the event handling function

  Returns:
    None.

  Example:
    <code>
    void APP_MyBufferEventHandler
    (
        DRV_NVM_EVENT event,
        DRV_NVM_BUFFER_HANDLE bufferHandle, 
        uintptr_t context
    )
    {
        MY_APP_DATA_STRUCT pAppData = (MY_APP_DATA_STRUCT) context;
        
        switch(event)
        {
            case DRV_NVM_EVENT_BUFFER_COMPLETE:

                // Handle the completed buffer. 
                break;
            
            case DRV_NVM_EVENT_BUFFER_ERROR:
            default:

                // Handle error.
                break;
        }
    }
    </code>

  Remarks:
    If the event is DRV_NVM_EVENT_BUFFER_COMPLETE, it means that the
    write or a erase operation was completed successfully. 
    
    If the event is DRV_NVM_EVENT_BUFFER_ERROR, it means that the scheduled
    operation was not completed successfully.
     
    The context parameter contains the a handle to the client context,  
    provided at the time the event handling function was  registered using the
    DRV_NVM_EventHandlerSet function. This context handle value is
    passed back to the client as the "context" parameter.  It can be any value
    necessary to identify the client context or instance (such as a pointer to
    the client's data) instance of the client that made the read/write/erase
    request.

    The event handler function executes in the driver peripheral's interrupt
    context when the driver is configured for interrupt mode operation. It is
    recommended of the application to not perform process intensive or blocking
    operations with in this function.

	<p><b>Implementation:</b> Dynamic</p>

  Description:
    This routine initializes the NVM driver instance for the specified
    driver index, making it ready for clients to open and use it.

  Precondition:
    None.
  
  Parameters:
    index -  Identifier for the instance to be initialized also the type of
             memory used
    init -   Pointer to a data structure containing any data necessary to
             initialize the driver.
  
  Returns:
    If successful, returns a valid handle to a driver instance object.
    Otherwise, it returns SYS_MODULE_OBJ_INVALID.
  
  Example:
    <code>
    // This code snippet shows an example
    // of initializing the NVM Driver.
    
    DRV_NVM_INIT    NVMInitData;

    This routine will NEVER block for hardware access. If the operation
    requires time to allow the hardware to reinitialize, it will be
    reported by the DRV_NVM_Status operation. The system must use
    DRV_NVM_Status to find out when the driver is in the ready state.
    
    Build configuration options may be used to statically override options
    in the "init" structure and will take precedence over initialization

    this routine where the status of a scheduled buffer needs to polled on. The
    function may return DRV_NVM_BUFFER_HANDLE_INVALID in a case where the buffer
    handle has expired. A buffer handle expires when the internal buffer object
    is re-assigned to another erase or write request.  It is recommended that
    this function be called regularly in order to track the buffer status
    correctly.

    The application can alternatively register an event handler to receive write
    or erase operation completion events.

  Preconditions:
    The DRV_NVM_Initialize routine must have been called.

    DRV_NVM_Open must have been called to obtain a valid opened device handle.

  Parameters:
    handle       - A valid open-instance handle, returned from the driver's
                   open routine

  Returns:
    A DRV_NVM_BUFFER_STATUS value describing the current status of the buffer.
    Returns DRV_NVM_BUFFER_HANDLE_INVALID if the client handle or the buffer
    handle is not valid.

  Example:
    <code>
    DRV_HANDLE                  handle;         // Returned from DRV_NVM_Open
    DRV_HANDLE                  bufferHandle;
    DRV_NVM_BUFFER_STATUS       status;
 
    status = DRV_NVM_BufferStatus(handle, bufferHandle);
    if(status == DRV_NVM_BUFFER_COMPLETED)
    {
        // Operation Done
    }
    </code>

  Remarks:
    This routine will not block for hardware access and will immediately return
    the current status.

  Summary:
    Allows a client to identify an event handling function for the driver to
    call back when queued operation has completed.
	<p><b>Implementation:</b> Dynamic</p>

  Description:
    This function allows a client to identify an event handling function 
    for the driver to call back when queued operation has completed.  
    When a client calls any read, write or erase function, it is provided with a
    handle identifying the buffer that was added to the driver's buffer queue.
    The driver will pass this handle back to the client by calling
    "eventHandler" function when the queued operation has completed.
    
    In a case where events are required, the event handler should be set before
    the client performs any write or erase operations that could generate
    events. The event handler once set, persists until the client closes the
    driver or sets another event handler (which could be a "NULL" pointer to
    indicate no callback).

  Precondition:
    The DRV_NVM_Initialize function must have been called for the
    specified NVM driver instance.

    DRV_NVM_Open must have been called to obtain a valid opened device
    handle.

  Parameters:
    handle       - A valid open-instance handle, returned from the driver's
                   open function

    eventHandler - Pointer to the event handler function implemented by the user
    
    context      - The value of parameter will be passed back to the client 
                   unchanged, when the eventHandler function is called. It can
                   be used to identify any client specific data object that 
                   identifies the instance of the client module (for example, 
                   it may be a pointer to the client module's state structure).

  Returns:
    None.

  Example:
