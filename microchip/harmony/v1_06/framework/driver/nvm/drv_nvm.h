/* NVM Driver command handle.

  Summary:
    Handle identifying commands queued in the driver.

  Description:
    A command handle is returned by a call to the Read, Write or Erase
    functions. This handle allows the application to track the completion
    of the operation. This command handle is also returned to the client
    along with the event that has occurred with respect to the command.
    This allows the application to connect the event to a specific
    command in case where multiple commands are queued.

    The command handle associated with the command request expires when the
    client has been notified of the completion of the command (after event
    handler function that notifies the client returns) or after the command
    has been retired by the driver if no event handler callback was set.

/* NVM Driver Event Handler Function Pointer

   Summary
    Pointer to a NVM Driver Event handler function

   Description
    This data type defines the required function signature for the NVM event
    handling callback function. A client must register a pointer to an event
    handling function whose function signature (parameter and return value 
    types) match the types specified by this function pointer in order to 
    receive event calls back from the driver.
    
    The parameters and return values are described here and a partial example
    implementation is provided.

  Parameters:
    event           - Identifies the type of event
    
    commandHandle   - Handle returned from the Read/Write/Erase requests
    
    context         - Value identifying the context of the application that
                      registered the event handling function

  Returns:
    None.

  Example:
    <code>
    void APP_MyNvmEventHandler
    (
        DRV_NVM_EVENT event,
        DRV_NVM_COMMAND_HANDLE commandHandle,
        uintptr_t context
    )
    {
        MY_APP_DATA_STRUCT pAppData = (MY_APP_DATA_STRUCT) context;
        
        switch(event)
        {
            case DRV_NVM_EVENT_COMMAND_COMPLETE:

                // Handle the completed buffer. 
                break;
            
            case DRV_NVM_EVENT_COMMAND_ERROR:
            default:

                // Handle error.
                break;
        }
    }
    </code>

  Remarks:
    If the event is DRV_NVM_EVENT_COMMAND_COMPLETE, it means that the
    write or a erase operation was completed successfully. 
    
    If the event is DRV_NVM_EVENT_COMMAND_ERROR, it means that the scheduled
    operation was not completed successfully.
     
    The context parameter contains the handle to the client context, provided
    at the time the event handling function was  registered using the
    DRV_NVM_EventHandlerSet function. This context handle value is
    passed back to the client as the "context" parameter.  It can be any value
    necessary to identify the client context or instance (such as a pointer to
    the client's data) instance of the client that made the read/write/erase
    request.

    The event handler function executes in the driver peripheral's interrupt
    context when the driver is configured for interrupt mode operation. It is
    recommended of the application to not perform process intensive or blocking
    operations within this function.

  Summary:
    Writes blocks of data starting from the specified address in flash memory.

  Description:
    This function schedules a non-blocking write operation for writing blocks
    of data into flash memory. The function returns with a valid buffer handle
    in the commandHandle argument if the write request was scheduled successfully.
    The function adds the request to the hardware instance queue and returns
    immediately. While the request is in the queue, the application buffer is
    owned by the driver and should not be modified. The function returns 
    DRV_NVM_COMMAND_HANDLE_INVALID in the commandHandle argument under the 
    following circumstances:
    - if a buffer object could not be allocated to the request
    - if the source buffer pointer is NULL
    - if the client opened the driver for read only
    - if the number of blocks to be written is either zero or more than the number
      of blocks actually available
    - if the write queue size is full or queue depth is insufficient
    - if the driver handle is invalid 

    If the requesting client registered an event callback with the driver, the
    driver will issue a DRV_NVM_EVENT_COMMAND_COMPLETE event if the
    buffer was processed successfully or DRV_NVM_EVENT_COMMAND_ERROR
    event if the buffer was not processed successfully.

  Precondition:
    The DRV_NVM_Initialize() routine must have been called for the specified
    NVM driver instance.

    DRV_NVM_Open() routine must have been called to obtain a valid opened device
    handle. DRV_IO_INTENT_WRITE or DRV_IO_INTENT_READWRITE must have been specified
    as a parameter to this routine.

    The flash address location which has to be written, must have be erased before
    using the DRV_NVM_Erase() routine.

  Parameters:
    handle        - A valid open-instance handle, returned from the driver's
                    open function

    commandHandle - Pointer to an argument that will contain the return buffer
                    handle
                   
    sourceBuffer  - The source buffer containing data to be programmed into NVM 
                    Flash

    blockStart    - Start block address of NVM Flash where the write should begin. 
                    This address should be aligned on a block boundary.

    nBlock        - Total number of blocks to be written. 

  Returns:
    The buffer handle is returned in the commandHandle argument. It will be
    DRV_NVM_COMMAND_HANDLE_INVALID if the request was not successful.

  Example:

  Summary:
    Erase and Write blocks of data starting from a specified address in flash
    memory.

  Description:
    This function combines the step of erasing a page and then writing the row.
    The application can use this function if it wants to avoid having to
    explicitly delete a page in order to update the rows contained in the page. 

    This function schedules a non-blocking operation to erase and write blocks
    of data into flash memory. The function returns with a valid buffer handle
    in the commandHandle argument if the write request was scheduled successfully.
    The function adds the request to the hardware instance queue and returns 
    immediately. While the request is in the queue, the application buffer is 
    owned by the driver and should not be modified. The function returns 
    DRV_NVM_COMMAND_HANDLE_INVALID in the commandHandle argument under the 
    following circumstances:
    - if a buffer could not be allocated to the request
    - if the input buffer pointer is NULL
    - if the client opened the driver for read only
    - if the buffer size is 0 
    - if the write queue size is full or queue depth is insufficient
    - if the driver handle is invalid 

    If the requesting client registered an event callback with the driver, the
    driver will issue a DRV_NVM_EVENT_COMMAND_COMPLETE event if the buffer
    was processed successfully or DRV_NVM_EVENT_COMMAND_ERROR event if 
    the buffer was not processed successfully.

  Precondition:
    The DRV_NVM_Initialize() routine must have been called for the specified
    NVM driver instance.

    The DRV_NVM_Open() must have been called with DRV_IO_INTENT_WRITE or 
    DRV_IO_INTENT_READWRITE as a parameter to obtain a valid opened device handle.

  Parameters:
    handle        - A valid open-instance handle, returned from the driver's
                    open function

    commandHandle - Pointer to an argument that will contain the return buffer
                    handle. If NULL, then buffer handle is not returned.
                   
    sourceBuffer  - The source buffer containing data to be programmed into NVM
                    Flash

    writeBlockStart - Start block address of NVM Flash where the write should begin.
                    This address should be aligned on a DRV_NVM_ROW_SIZE byte 
                    boundary.

    nWriteBlock   - Total number of blocks to be written. 

  Returns:

  Summary:
    Allows a client to identify an event handling function for the driver to

  Description:
    This function allows a client to identify an event handling function for
    the driver to call back when queued operation has completed.  
    When a client calls a write or erase function, it is provided with a
    handle identifying the buffer that was added to the driver's buffer queue.
    The driver will pass this handle back to the client by calling "eventHandler"
    function when the queued operation has completed.
    
    The event handler should be set before the client performs any write or erase
    operations that could generate events. The event handler once set, persists
    until the client closes the driver or sets another event handler (which could
    be a "NULL" pointer to indicate no callback).

  Precondition:
    The DRV_NVM_Initialize() routine must have been called for the
    specified NVM driver instance.

    The DRV_NVM_Open() routine must have been called to obtain a valid opened device
    handle.

  Parameters:
    handle       - A valid open-instance handle, returned from the driver's
                   open function

    eventHandler - Pointer to the event handler function implemented by the user
    
    context      - The value of parameter will be passed back to the client 
                   unchanged, when the eventHandler function is called. It can
                   be used to identify any client specific data object that 
                   identifies the instance of the client module (for example, 
                   it may be a pointer to the client module's state structure).

  Returns:
    None.

  Example:
    <code>
    // myAppObj is an application specific state data object.
    MY_APP_OBJ myAppObj;

    uint8_t myBuffer[MY_BUFFER_SIZE];

  Summary:
    Returns the physical attach status of the NVM.

  Description:
    This function returns the physical attach status of the NVM.

  Precondition:
    The DRV_NVM_Initialize() routine must have been called for the specified 
    NVM driver instance.

    The DRV_NVM_Open() routine must have been called to obtain a valid opened
    device handle.

  Parameters:
    handle       - A valid open-instance handle, returned from the driver's
                   open function

  Returns:
    Returns false if the handle is invalid otherwise returns true.

  Example:
    <code> 

    // The NVM media is always attached and so the below
    // always returns true.
    
    bool isNVMAttached;
    isNVMAttached = DRV_NVM_isAttached(drvNVMHandle);
