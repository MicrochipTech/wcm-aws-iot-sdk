/* NVM Driver instance configuration

  Summary:
    Selects the maximum number of Driver instances that can be supported by
    the dynamic driver.

  Description:
    This definition selects the maximum number of Driver instances that can be
    supported by the dynamic driver. In case of this driver, multiple instances
    of the driver could use the same hardware instance.

  Remarks:
    This macro is mandatory when building the driver for dynamic operation.

  Summary:
    Selects the maximum number of clients

  Description:
    This definition selects the maximum number of clients that the NVM driver
    can supported at run time. This constant defines the total number of NVM
    driver clients that will be available to all instances of the NVM driver.

  Remarks:
    This macro is mandatory when building the driver for dynamic operation.

/* NVM Driver maximum number of buffer objects

  Summary:
    Selects the maximum number of buffer objects

  Description:
    This definition selects the maximum number of buffer objects. This
    indirectly also specifies the queue depth. The NVM Driver can queue up
    DRV_NVM_BUFFER_OBJECT_NUMBER of read/write/erase requests before return a
    DRV_NVM_BUFFER_HANDLE_INVALID due to the queue being full. Buffer objects
    are shared by all instances of the driver. Increasing this number increases
    the RAM requirement of the driver.

  Remarks:
    This macro is mandatory when building the driver for dynamic operation.

  Summary:
    Macro specifies operation of the driver to be in the interrupt mode
    or polled mode

  Description:
    This macro specifies operation of the driver to be in the interrupt mode
    or polled mode

    - true  - Select if interrupt mode of NVM operation is desired
    - false - Select if polling mode of NVM operation is desired
