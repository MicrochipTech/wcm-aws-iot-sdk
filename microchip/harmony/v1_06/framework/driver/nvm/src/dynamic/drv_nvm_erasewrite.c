  Description:
    The NVM Driver provides a interface to access the NVM on the PIC32
    microcontroller. This file implements the NVM Driver Erase Write function.
    This file should be included in the project if NVM driver Erase Write
    functionality is needed.

/* Function:
    void DRV_NVM_EraseWrite
    (
        const DRV_HANDLE handle,
        DRV_NVM_COMMAND_HANDLE * commandHandle,
        void * sourceBuffer,
        uint32_t writeBlockStart,
        uint32_t nWriteBlock
    )

  Summary:
    Erase and Write blocks of data starting from a specified address in flash
    memory.

  Description:
    This function combines the step of erasing a page and then writing the row.
    The application can use this function if it wants to avoid having to
    explicitly delete a page in order to update the rows contained in the page. 

    This function schedules a non-blocking operation to erase and write blocks
    of data into flash memory. The function returns with a valid buffer handle
    in the commandHandle argument if the write request was scheduled successfully.
    The function adds the request to the hardware instance queue and returns 
    immediately. While the request is in the queue, the application buffer is 
    owned by the driver and should not be modified. The function returns 
    DRV_NVM_COMMAND_HANDLE_INVALID in the commandHandle argument under the 
    following circumstances:
    - if a buffer could not be allocated to the request
    - if the input buffer pointer is NULL
    - if the client opened the driver for read only
    - if the buffer size is 0 
    - if the write queue size is full or queue depth is insufficient
    - if the driver handle is invalid 

    If the requesting client registered an event callback with the driver, the
    driver will issue a DRV_NVM_EVENT_COMMAND_COMPLETE event if the buffer
    was processed successfully or DRV_NVM_EVENT_COMMAND_ERROR event if 
    the buffer was not processed successfully.

  Remarks:
    Refer to drv_nvm.h for usage information.
