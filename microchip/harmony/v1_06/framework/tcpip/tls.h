  Summary:
    The TLS layer adds encryption support to the TCP layer by providing an interface
    for including an application specific TLS layer

  Description:
    The TLS module adds encryption support to the TCP layer by providing an interface
    for including an application specific TLS layer.  It is up to the application
    to provide the mechanism for negotiating connection, encrypting and decrypting
    traffic.

  Function:
    bool TCPIP_TCPTLS_ClientStart(TCP_SOCKET hTCP, uint8_t* host, uint8_t certIndex)

  Summary:
    Begins an TLS client session.

  Description:
    This function escalates the current connection to an TLS secured
    connection by initiating an TLS client handshake.

  Precondition:
    TCP is initialized and hTCP is already connected.

  Parameters:
    hTCP        - TCP connection to secure
    host        - Expected host name on certificate (currently ignored)
    certIndex   - Passed through to the TLS layer's clientCreate function.  It 
                  can be used to select a specific certificate for client certificate
                  validation, or it can be ignored

  Return Values:
    true        - a TLS connection was initiated
    false       - Insufficient TLS resources (stubs) were available

  Remarks:
    The host parameter is currently ignored and is not validated.

/*****************************************************************************
  Function:

  Summary:
    Begins a TLS server session.

  Description:
    This function sets up a TLS server session when a new connection is
    established on an TLS port.

  Precondition:
    TCP is initialized and hTCP is already connected.

  Parameters:
    hTCP        - TCP connection to secure
    certIndex   - Passed through to the TLS layer's serverCreate function.  It 
                  can be used to select a specific certificate to be used as the
                  server certificate, or ic can be ignored

  Description:
    Call this function after calling TCPIP_TCPTLS_ClientStart until false is
    returned.  Then your application may continue with its normal data
    transfer (which is now secured).

  Precondition:
    TCP is initialized and hTCP is connected.

  Parameters:
    hTCP        - TCP connection to check
